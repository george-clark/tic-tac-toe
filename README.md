# Intro
A basic tic tac toe game to familiarize myself with react. Based on
the [official react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up).

# Changes

## Refactors
* Duplication of `this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O';` turned into `currentPlayer` method.

## Planned Changes

### UI
The UI will receive a full presentation overhaul. The objective is a professional looking website.
